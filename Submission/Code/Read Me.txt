### Introduction ###
The messages from the program will be displayed in the console and the
map will be displayed in the main game window.

### Controls ###
To use the pathfinding program, start it up and use the following keys
to find the paths:

Press [1] To load a map.
Press [2] To run the A* algorithm.
Press [3] To train the NeuralNetwork.
Press [4] To run the NeuralNetwork which produces a path.
Press [5] To shuffle the biases in the NeuralNetwork (You will need to retrain [3]).

### Loading a Map ###
Before you can train or run the pathfinding algorithms you need to first
load a map by pressing [1]. This will open an open file dialog box where
you can select a file.

### A* Pathfinding ###
You can run the A* pathfinding method uby pressing 2.

### Neural Network Training & Pathfinding ###
To use the neural network you will need to load a map and then press 3 to
train the network. Not doing this will produce a garbage path when you get
the path. To run the path you need to press 4 and then the newly trained
neural network will run and return a valid path (based on the training).
Finally if no particular path could be found (meaning that the max iterations
have been reached with no suitable path found) theny you can press 5 to
randomise the biases and train again. Luck is a big component of this training
method.
